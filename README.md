### Hi there 👋

My name is Leo Sandler. I'm a third year Computer Engineering student at Queen's University. I’m passionate about solving problems with AI.

- 🧠 I’m currently developing a BCI for live spelling using machine learning with the [QCLI](https://www.queensbrainwaves.com) team. 
  - [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/Cerebral-Language-Innovation/Brainwaves-to-Letters)
- 🤝 Open source development is engaging to me. I've contributed to SciPy ([my merged pull request](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/17906)) and am in the process of contributing to the [TDC](https://github.com/mims-harvard/TDC) open source drug discovery repository.
